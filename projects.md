## Projects

### Personal and Open Source

I co-host the weekly [Virtual Brown Bag](http://virtualbrownbag.com/) meetup. Open to all, you should join in!

I am the creator of several open source projects that are hopefully useful to people.

* [persistState Widget](https://bitbucket.org/togakangaroo/ow.persiststate) - is a little jquery widget that will store the state of html widgets in localstorage and restore it on next page visit
* [simple-modules](https://github.com/togakangaroo/simple-modules) - is a javascript module system micro-library to help messy brownfield projects transition to cleaner code
* [ApprovalTests.BetterPdfVerification](https://github.com/togakangaroo/ApprovalTests.BetterPdfVerification) - is a set of approvers for the .Net version of the amazing ApprovalTests assertion framework. It makes approving of pdf files actually work as it normalizes out inconsistencies such as timestamps and auto generated ids.
* [Oaf.DeploymentInfo](https://bitbucket.org/oliverwymantechssg/oaf.deploymentinfo) - is a nuget package that will automatically embed information on your deployment into your project
* [thee](https://github.com/togakangaroo/thee) - a micro-library to shift `this` in javascript to a regular parameter.
* [log4net.GrowlAppender](https://bitbucket.org/togakangaroo/log4net.growlappender) - is a simple .Net library that will direct log4net messages to a locally running Growl instance
* A [bunch of nuget packages](https://www.nuget.org/profiles/togakangaroo)
* Some [npm packages](https://www.npmjs.com/~togakangaroo)
* [gimgen](https://github.com/togakangaroo/gimgen) - a library for using javascript generators for functional reactive programming
* [The Estimation Checklist](https://github.com/togakangaroo/estimation-checklist) - a checklist to asist with doing estimation

I also dabble in software security, virtual reality, and IoT programming
