I'm putting together a workshop on estimation of large projects and features for the [Operation Spark](https://www.operationspark.org/) coding bootcamp and ended up mind mapping several dozen *always-make-sure-to-discuss-this* rules of thumb. I figure, why keep this private? I have plenty of experience but that's still just me. Let's open it up for public contribution.

[So here is a github repo](https://github.com/togakangaroo/estimation-checklist). It contains a simple `.md` file so you can edit it entirely in-browser. Fork, edit, and give me a PR to share your experience!
