My low effort blog. Compiled to a static site with [[https://jekyllrb.com][Jekyll]].

* Building and Running
  :PROPERTIES:
  :header-args: :results output

** Build Image 
   
  First build the image from the local [[file:./Dockerfile][Dockerfile]].
 
  #+begin_src shell
  docker build -t "jekyll" .
  #+end_src
  
** Create and run container from image 
   
  If you would like to run from org mode directly, you will need to have ~ob-async~ installed so the ~:async~ directive below works.
  
  #+begin_src emacs-lisp
  (require 'ob-async)
  #+end_src
  
  Otherwise you can simply copy and paste the following into a shell.
    
  We can then run the site with [[./build-site.sh][build-site.sh]]

  #+begin_src shell :async
  ./build-site.sh --watch
  #+end_src

  #+RESULTS:

  or if you don't care about watching the file system for changes and recompiling

  #+begin_src shell :async
  ./build-site.sh
  #+end_src
  
  Give it a minute to start and you can then [[http://localhost:4000][visit the running site]].

  To stop the container run

 #+begin_src shell :results none
 docker kill blog
 #+end_src

** Also useful

 List all running containers
 
 #+begin_src shell :results output list
 docker ps -a
 #+end_src

 To list all local images
 
 #+begin_src shell :results output table
 docker images
 #+end_src
