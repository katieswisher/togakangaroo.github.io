I'm George Mauer

This is my low effort blog. Mostly about software development. I regularly do presentations at various usergroups. I sometimes do them to my cat.

I am a senior developer with [Surge Consulting Group](http://www.surgeforward.com/). If you've interviewed with us chances are I talked your ear off for the better part of two hours.

[Find me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/togakangaroo) or try out the Disqus forms on my posts and let me know if they work. In general, it's not very hard to find a way to contact me.
