		<p>From our chatlogs at Surge (editted for berevity and to make me seem like a better debater/speller).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>GM: Can I just say, I hate </p>
<pre><code>that = this

or

self = this
</code></pre>

<p>GM: Don't anyone do that</p>
<p>GM: The pattern is fine, but at least give it a meaningful name</p>
<p>JA: Hmmm.....I'll bite, devil's advocate</p>
<p>JA: Why not folow an established convention? When javascript programmers see a variable name &quot;that&quot;, they immediately know what's happening</p>
<p>TS: anyone who has worked in JS for more than 10 seconds does :)</p>
<p>GM: @TS -  right, they know that here is a variable passed in from a broader scope. However, when you use a variable you care far more about what it reperesents than where it came from, and in order to learn what &quot;that&quot; represents you have to scan the whole file, find the line that assings <code>var that = this;</code> then figure out in your head what <code>this</code> refers to.</p>
<p>SP: yeah. it can get frustrating</p>
<p>GM: It really takes like 2 seconds to think of an appropriate name for the variable. I usually prefix with an _ just so that it sticks out a bit visually: _userModel, _slideViewer, _dialogWidget. Its not perfect but its a heck of a lot better than &quot;that&quot;.</p>
<p>GM: Variables should almost always be named after what they do/represent, not how they're implemented. Clearly we are breaking this guideline if we've got variables named &quot;that&quot; in different files having nothing to do with each other. The argument that it's a well known pattern isn't wrong, just that there's really no reason not to give it an even <em>more</em> descriptive name and not even have to think of the pattern.</p>
<p>GM: So I guess my real point is name things properly, it will be better for everyone always and &quot;that&quot;, &quot;self&quot; are just not great names.</p>
