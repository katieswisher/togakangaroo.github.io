		When programming indentation is really useful for helping you keep track of things. Usually, if a part of the program is contained in another part, you will want to indent it.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="html">
&lt;p&gt;
	like this!
&lt;p&gt;
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code class="javascript">
function anExample() {
	return "or like this";
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is true for html, css, and javascript (although what "inside of" means is different for each one).
	</p>
	<p>
		Practice proper indentation by making the code on the left match the code on the right. Do this by focusing on using the <kbd>Tab</kbd>, <kbd>Enter</kbd>, and <kbd>Backspace</kbd> keys. Don't forget that you can quickly move through through code with the keyboard by using <kbd>ctrl+&lt;-</kbd> and <kbd>ctrl+-&gt;</kbd>.
