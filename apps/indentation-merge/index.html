	<h2>Indentation</h2>
	<p>
		When programming indentation is really useful for helping you keep track of things. Usually, if a part of the program is contained in another part, you will want to indent it.
	</p>
	<pre><code class="html">
&lt;p&gt;
	like this!
&lt;p&gt;
	</code></pre>
	<pre><code class="javascript">
function anExample() {
	return "or like this";
}
	</code></pre>
	<p>
		This is true for html, css, and javascript (although what "inside of" means is different for each one).
	</p>
	<p>
		Practice proper indentation by making the code on the left match the code on the right. 
	</p>
	<p>
		Do this by focusing on using the <span class="shortcut">Tab</span>, <span class="shortcut">Enter</span>, and <span class="shortcut">Backspace</span> keys. 
	</p>
	<p>
	Don't forget that you can quickly move through through code with the keyboard by using <span class="shortcut">ctrl</span> + <span class="shortcut"><i class="fa fa-arrow-left"></i></span> and <span class="shortcut">ctrl</span> + <span class="shortcut"><i class="fa fa-arrow-right"></i></span>.
